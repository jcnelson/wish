\Section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented the design of our initial version of WISH.
However, there is still significant future work remaining within the WISH
project. The current version of WISH lacks per user access controls, so all
hosts within the WISH federation have equal privileges. In a production ready
version of WISH, we would like to provide full user level access controls when
WISH is used in conjunction with a directory system such as LDAP.
Additionally, we would like to provide more advanced tools for dealing with job
output, so that users can more easily switch between streams of job output in
real time. In the current version, all job output is either printed to the
user's shell or sent to a file, but we'd like to support more varied forms of
output. 

Throughout this paper, we have described our design of the WISH system, and we
have used our experience with PlanetLab as a motivating example. WISH
introduces novel tools which allow users to use advanced parallel and
distributed techniques within the UNIX shell of their choice. In this paper,
we have described some initial uses for WISH, but we hope that many more will be
found once the project is exposed to a wider audience.
